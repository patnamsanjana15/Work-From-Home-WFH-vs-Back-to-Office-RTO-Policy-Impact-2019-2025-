# Work-From-Home (WFH) vs Back-to-Office (RTO) Policy Impact (2019–2025)
**A Data Visualization & Policy Analysis Project Using Tableau**

This project analyzes the long-term trends, industry differences, labor market shifts, and commute-related benefits associated with Work-From-Home (WFH) policies. It leverages high-quality datasets from the **WFH Research Institute** to evaluate how remote work has evolved before, during, and after COVID-19 — and what this means for employers, employees, and policymakers.

## 📊 1. Project Objective
To evaluate the long-term impact of WFH policies by analyzing:
- Remote work adoption over time  
- Industry-level shifts in remote eligibility  
- Trends in remote-friendly job postings  
- The relationship between remote flexibility and hiring demand  
- Commute time savings from WFH  
- Policy recommendations comparing WFH vs RTO

The goal is to determine whether organizations benefit more from WFH, RTO, or a hybrid model — based on real data from 2019–2025.

## 📈 3. Visualizations (Tableau)

### **1. WFH Share Over Time (1965–2025)**
- Shows the structural shift caused by COVID-19  
- Highlights vaccine rollout & return-to-office phases  

### **2. WFH Before vs After COVID-19 (By Industry)**
- Dumbbell/bar hybrid chart  
- Shows biggest winners: Computer/Math, Business/Finance  

### **3. Remote-Friendly Job Postings Trend (2019–2025)**
- Line chart with 3-month moving average  
- Peak in 2022 followed by normalization  

### **4. Hiring Flexibility vs Job Demand**
- Scatter plot + trendline  
- No strong correlation → remote flexibility does not increase hiring volume  

### **5. Commute Hours Saved Per Worker**
- Area chart showing massive commute reductions during COVID  
- Stabilizes at higher-than-pre-pandemic levels

## 🔍 4. Key Insights
- **WFH is structurally higher than pre-pandemic levels** and unlikely to return to 2019 norms.  
- **Industries differ drastically** — knowledge-based roles gained the most in WFH adoption.  
- **Remote-friendly job postings peaked in 2022** and declined during the RTO push.  
- **Remote flexibility did not increase hiring demand**, based on job posting volume.  
- **Commute savings remain substantial**, supporting hybrid/WFH policies.  

---

## 🧭 5. Policy Recommendation
Based on the findings, **a hybrid work model** provides the best balance for both workers and employers — optimizing productivity, flexibility, hiring reach, and commute savings while still allowing in-person collaboration where needed.
